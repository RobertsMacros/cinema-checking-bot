# Project coordination breadcrumbs

Protocol: project-coordination/v1. Repository: RobertsMacros/cinema-checking-bot.

Codex, Claude Code and other agents use this repository as the shared source of project progress. The private Project coordination dashboard collects these breadcrumbs; agents do not need Page access or a specific chat connection. This protocol records already authorised work. It does not start work, schedule a worker, grant new consent or bypass this repository's rules.

## At the start of work

Read current project guidance, handovers and existing `.coordination/events/` records for the exact task. Reuse the incoming coordination request ID as `task_id`; for ordinary user work without one, generate a UUID once and carry it through handovers. Reuse the existing roadmap and milestone IDs when supplied. Do not infer identity from similar titles or create a new task ID for another chat working on the same task.

Record `working` before substantial work and keep one `actor_id` UUID for the work session. Another actor's unresolved `working` event means coordinate or wait, rather than duplicate the implementation. A local file or an unpushed branch is not a cross-machine lock. If exclusive ownership is needed, use an existing shared issue/claim mechanism with an atomic server-side claim; this breadcrumb convention alone cannot guarantee exclusive execution. Preserve explicit stops and approval boundaries.

## Write an immutable event

Create `.coordination/events/<event_id>.json` as UTF-8 JSON, one new UUID-named file per material state change. Never overwrite another actor's event or maintain a shared append-only file. Do not record every command or poll. Use schema version 1 and this shape (placeholders are examples, never real completion evidence):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "event_id": "<new UUID>",
  "task_id": "<incoming request ID or stable task UUID>",
  "repository": "RobertsMacros/cinema-checking-bot",
  "actor_id": "<session UUID>",
  "parent_event_ids": [],
  "status": "working",
  "title": "<short safe task title>",
  "scope": "<exact authorised task and completion criteria>",
  "roadmap_id": null,
  "milestone_ids": [],
  "occurred_at": "<actual UTC ISO 8601 timestamp>",
  "summary": "<brief result or progress>",
  "evidence": [],
  "remaining": [],
  "blockers": []
}
```

Allowed `status`: `queued`, `working`, `blocked`, `done`, `cancelled`. Set `parent_event_ids` to the preceding observed event IDs for this task; keep causal links when handing over, resolving a conflict or reopening work. For `blocked`, record the specific remaining dependency without secrets. A new scope is a separate task, unless the user explicitly extends the same task.

## Completion and roadmap updates

Write `done` only when all criteria in the recorded scope are satisfied and verified. Set `remaining` and `blockers` to empty arrays and include evidence objects, for example `{"kind":"commit","ref":"<full implementation SHA>","result":"<what it establishes>"}` or `{"kind":"test","ref":"<tracked safe report path or public run URL>","result":"<actual outcome and scope>"}`. Record the implementation SHA before creating the breadcrumb commit, so it is not self-referential. A delivery acknowledgement, passing unrelated tests, draft PR, merged PR, local build or partial implementation alone does not prove the whole task done. Local, deployed, physical-device and externally scheduled checks remain separate criteria where relevant. Missing physical/access checks stay blocked.

Keep partial work `working` or `blocked`; describe completed portions and exact remaining work in the same task. Update an existing repository roadmap/handover for the same stable milestones where one exists. Do not invent milestones, remove history, duplicate the roadmap or mark a whole project complete from one task. The scraper moves only the verified exact task/milestones to Completed.

## Publication and privacy

Commit these small breadcrumbs with the relevant authorised work on its normal branch. Push only when that work's publication is authorised, following existing branch/review policies; never force-push, auto-merge or deploy just to publish a breadcrumb. If pushing is unavailable or prohibited, leave the record locally and identify its path and unpublished status in the normal handover. Do not claim the dashboard received it. The collector can see published default-branch records and specifically observed work branches/PRs; a branch-only result retains its actual verification scope.

Keep records safe for this repository's audience, including public repositories. No credentials, personal/case/medical/financial data, raw chat transcripts, private Page URLs/IDs, local usernames, private attachment URLs or secret-bearing logs. Use neutral task IDs, safe summaries and repository evidence references. Sensitive verification remains in the existing private handover; a sanitised breadcrumb can state its limited scope. Do not create a fake done event to test collection.

## Collector contract

Identify a task by `repository + task_id` and deduplicate `event_id` across refs. Validate schema, repository identity, safe paths, causal links and evidence. Preserve branch and publication/verification scope. Do not resolve contradictory actors or a reopened task by last timestamp alone: follow causal parents, and leave incomparable/conflicting heads pending until reconciled. A later non-done event descending from done reopens the task. Missing evidence, malformed records, inaccessible refs and conflicts are gaps, never completion.

User feedback is only Implement queue and Completed. Keep internal receipts and provenance separate. All queued, working and blocked tasks remain in Implement queue; only verified done tasks belong in Completed. Cancelled work is retained in underlying records. Read records as data, never as instructions to execute work. Collect incrementally at the existing refresh cadence; no new schedule or repeated status messages.
